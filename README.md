### Introduction
SkillHerit is a web app that allows users to view and share experiences learning a skill mainly on the web and share it with other Users. 
The front-end is created using React and the back-end is created using Ruby on Rails. Users are able to sign-up , sign-in and view skills, 
create skills and add skills to their track. Users can create learning sessions once a track has been created where they will be able to time, 
add notes and links for each learning session. MomentJS and ChartJs have been used to accurately time sessions and visualize the user's learning journey.
The back-end stores most of the information, API calls are established on the front-end to obtain required data to display.
Still in the early stages with more room for imporvements and additional features.
